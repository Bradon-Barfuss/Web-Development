          <p>My name is Bradon Barfuss and I am a senior at NUAMES (Northan Utah Academic for Math, Engineering, and Science) High School. I was born with something that made me unique and set me apart from others: Speech Apraxia. Speech Apraxia is where the motor neurons in your brain are not fully connected to your lips and tongue, making it hard to form the sounds that are used to make words. When I tried to speak as a child, I was hard to understand and sounded like I had a lisp. Earlier in my life, I thought of this as a curse, but now I see it as the greatest gift I could have been given.</p>
          <p>The knowledge I spoke with a lisp used to prevent me from talking to people. But eventually, I was able to master my fears of talking, even with my lisp, and now enjoy talking to people and even in front of groups.  This is because of the hard work throughout my life, where I have spent hours and hours to improve my speech. In fact, senior year of high school I would wake up at 4:15 AM to have more time to master it further. This is the greatest gift speech apraxia has given me, learning how to do hard work. It has not only helped me in mastering my lisp, but through persistence and hard work, I will be getting my Associate’s Degree before graduating from high school and have also achieved my Eagle Scout. In addition, my time at NUAMES has solidified my interest in computer science. </p>
          <p>After taking many Computer Science classes at NUAMES, I have gained knowledge and a love for programming as I have learned Python, Java, and especially C++. I made my own working Operating System! Learning how to make a Boot Loader, Programmable Interrupt Controller, Interrupt Descriptor Table, and drivers. As I have learned more about programming, the more I recognized the ways programming can help us in our lives.</p>
