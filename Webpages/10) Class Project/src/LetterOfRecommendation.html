            <p>I feel honored to write a letter of recommendation for Bradon Barfuss. Honored because I have known Bradon since he was very young and have seen his amazing growth over the years.  Bradon lives in my neighborhood and we attend the same ecclesiastical congregation together. He is a very diligent individual in his ecclesiastical assignments, as well as in his personal goals.</p>
            <p>Bradon has developed the ability to teach and lead others. He currently has a very demanding ecclesiastical assignment to lead other young men his own age. He is responsible for planning, communicating, and executing activities that are both faith based as well as entertaining. Not only does Bradon do this weekly assignment willingly, he has the maturity and perspective that allows him to realize that he is a part of something bigger than himself. He realizes that although he and his peers have different strengths and weakness they are stronger when they are together. Bradon has developed his leadership skills since he was young. He leads by not only his example but also through his weekly faith based instruction.</p>
            <p>Over the years I have seen Bradon excel as a member of the Boy Scouts of America. He overcame obstacles, worked hard, and steadily progressed to achieve the Eagle Scout Award. This achievement took planning and diligence over a long period of time. Bradon did this on his own. He is an individual that is able to make a plan, follow through with the plan, adjust if needed, all to achieve his end goal.</p>
            <p>Bradon has learned to learn. He is self-aware of his disabilities and has developed the skills and abilities to succeed in anything he chooses to undertake. Although he is presented with challenges in life, as we all are, he has learned to augment those challenges with his strengths.</p>
            <p> If you have the opportunity to have Bradon as one of your employees or as a member of your team your company and/or team will be strengthen as a result of Bradon.</p>
            <p>Sincerely,
            David Moore
